## Access to Complete Unity Project
Because of the size of Unity Projects, the use of GitHub is not ideal. For this reason, only the essential scripts live here. 
Instead we made use of the [Unity Collaboration Tool](https://unity3d.com/services/collaborate).
If you would like access to our entire Unity project, please contact one of us and we will gladly add you to the project.
