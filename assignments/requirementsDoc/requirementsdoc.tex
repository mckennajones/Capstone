\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
The main goal of the project is to make customers feel more inclined to purchase
Columbia gear through the use of an immersive, outdoor Virtual Reality
experience. This document exists both for development of the project and to provide a detailed description of the technical requirements for the clients.

\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{| m{3cm} | m{9cm} |}
		\hline
		Virtual Reality & Sometimes shortened as VR \\
		\hline
		HTC Vive & A virtual reality headset produced by HTC \\
		\hline
		Unity Game Engine & The Unity Game Engine, developed by Unity Technologies
    is used in this project to develop the virtual reality simulation. \\
    \hline
    Avatar & An icon or figure representing a particular person. \\
    \hline
    Wands & Controllers that are used with the HTC headset. \\

\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
This VR product may be unique to the company but will still have ties to
existing products. Within the experience users will have the ability to view
and interact with Columbia gear. Users will also be given the opportunity to
wear Columbia gear while participating to learn how the clothes feel while
executing certain movements.

\subsection{Constraints}
A virtual reality headset like the HTC Vive has some inherent restrictions.
The first one is space. The HTC Vive tracks how much space you have set the
system up in and creates virtual barriers. This limitation can be alleviated by
using the controllers to move the users within VR environment. A second
limitation is graphics within VR is not perfectly realistic. Because we are
trying to promote Columbia Sportswear Gear it needs to be as realistic as
possible.

\subsection{Product Functions}
The VR setup will allow the user to simulate outdoor experiences.
Specifically, the user will be able to virtually try on Columbia Sportswear
gear in the environments they are intended to be used in.
This will be done using the HTC Vive headset and wands. The final product
will allow the user to travel to a number of environments in a given session to
test a range of clothes and equipment.

Third or first person view?
Social aspect? Adding to cart?

\subsection{User Characteristics}
The general type of user of this project will be a customer at a Columbia
Sportswear retail store. Under this umbrella lies a few different types of
customers. First there are customers who are unexperienced in the outdoor
activity they are buying gear for. This target audience will benefit most
from the VR expreience as it will give them an idea of what they
are getting themselves into (too vague). Secondly there are customers who are
experienced in the activity they are buying gear for. This audience will
benefit from the VR experience because it will allow them to view themselves
actually using the gear.

\section{Specific Requirements}
\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 360 degree view of outdoor scenario within VR experience.
  \item User view projected onto external display.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ability for users to interact with fly fishing equipment.
  \item Ability for users to view their own avatar movements (In a pop-up
  window?)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Must be responsive enough to prevent user distraction.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Aim for no delays longer than 100ms.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Application must be portable.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software System Attributes}
Our unity environment should be portable and work on all htc vive systems.
Correctness can be evaluated by how authentic the real-world experience we're
trying to replicate is. We should be able to adjust the scenes easily and
accommodate for any changes that the client wants.
