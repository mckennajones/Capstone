\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
The main goal of the project is to make customers feel more inclined to purchase
Columbia gear through the use of an immersive, outdoor Virtual Reality
experience. This document exists both for development of the project and to provide a detailed description of the technical requirements for the clients.

\subsection{Scope}
We want to create an outdoor virtual reality experience for customers at a
Columbia retail store. The application will consist of both visual and audio
experiences to create an outdoor world in which the user can navigate. The main
activity available will involve fly fishing in one of the rivers within the
environment. Users will also have the ability to interact with Columbia products
while in the experience and gain specific product information.

\subsection{Overview}
The next chapter of the document will give an overview of the basic functionality
of the Virtual Reality product. It contains informal requirements to provide
background for the third section, Specific Requirements. The third section
will provide more detailed requirements. This section is intended for a more
technical audience like developers.

\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
This VR product may be unique to the company but will still have ties to
existing products. Within the experience, users will have the ability to view
and interact with Columbia gear. Users will also be given the opportunity to
wear Columbia gear while participating to learn how the clothes feel while
executing certain movements.

\subsection{Product Functions}
The VR setup will allow the user to simulate outdoor experiences.
Specifically, the user will be able to virtually try on Columbia Sportswear
gear in the environments they are intended to be used in.
This will be done using the HTC Vive headset and wands. The final product
will allow the user to travel to a number of environments in a given session to
test a variety of clothes and equipment. This product will also give customers
the ability to save the gear they liked in the VR, and access that information after the experience is over.

\subsection{User Characteristics}
The general type of user of this project will be a customer at a Columbia
Sportswear retail store. Under this umbrella lies a few different types of
customers. First there are customers who are inexperienced in the outdoor
activity they are buying gear for. This target audience will benefit most
from the VR expreience as it will allow them to experience the activity without a lot of commitment.
Secondly, there are customers who are
experienced in the activity they are buying gear for. This audience will
benefit from the VR experience because it will allow them to view themselves
actually using the gear.

\subsection{Constraints}
A virtual reality headset like the HTC Vive has some inherent restrictions.
The first one is space. The HTC Vive tracks how much space you have set the
system up in and creates virtual barriers. This limitation can be alleviated by
using the controllers to move the users within VR environment. Besides physical
space, space in the virtual display is also a concern. Information needs to be
supplied to the user without obstructing the VR experience. A second
limitation are the graphics within the VR environemnt are not entirely
realistic. Because we are trying to promote Columbia Sportswear Gear it needs
to be as authentic aspossible.

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
todo

\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}
One part of the project that will likely be delayed until later versions is the social aspect.
Ideally the user would be able to share their VR experience on social media sites like Facebook or Youtube.
This could be in the form or 360 degree images or videos.
At the moment this requirement is not a high priority.

\section{Specific Requirements}
\subsection{External Interfaces}
need to be more specific for each item
\begin{itemize}
  \item 360 degree view of outdoor scenario within VR experience.
  \item User view projected onto external display.
  \item Product information available inside VR Experience.
  \item Optional user guidance (audio/visual).
  \item Physical \"wand\" controller available to be held by user.
  \item HTC Vive virtual reality equipment with visual, audio, and tactile capabilities.
  \item Built to be experiences in confined room (no bigger than 12 feet by 12 feet).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ability for users to interact with fly fishing equipment.
  \item Ability to see Columbia fishing apparel in use.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Must be responsive enough to prevent user distraction.\cite{michalak_lind_round1}\cite{michalak_lind_round2}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software System Attributes}
Our unity environment should be portable and work on all htc vive systems.
Correctness can be evaluated by how authentic the real-world experience we're
trying to replicate is. We should be able to adjust the scenes easily and
accommodate for any changes that the client wants.

\subsubsection{Reliability}
todo
\subsubsection{Availability}
todo
\subsubsection{Security}
todo
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
As time goes on it should be easy to adapt the product to easily include more
Columbia Sportswear products and virtual reality environments to accompany them.

\subsubsection{Portability}
