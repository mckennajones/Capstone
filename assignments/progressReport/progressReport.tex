\section{Project Overview}


\section{Problems Encountered}


\section{Weekly Progress}
\subsection{Week 3}
This week we spent most of our time working on our Problem Statement which aimed to define the problem and make sure that everyone on the team and the sponsors were all on the same page.
In order to complete this assignment we had a conference call with our sponsors Mike Premi from Intel and Tim Delvin from Columbia to discuss their visions and scope of the project.
We were able to break down their requirements and discussed strategies going forward.

\subsection{Week 4}
We first spent some time working this week revising our Problem Statement.
Luckily our Problem Statement was used as an example during class so we received some very valuable feedback from Kirsten.
After that we moved on to getting the Unity Gaming Engine set up on our computers and familiarizing ourselves with the tool.

\subsection{Week 5}
This week we made progress in a few areas.
First we finished up our Problem Statement based on suggestions from Kirsten, the TA's, and our clients.
Next we made plans to get our own virtual reality gear from our clients.
Before this decision there had been discussion of us sharing VR gear with another Capstone team who is also doing a VR project with Intel.
While this would have been doable, we all decided it would be much simpler to recieve our own equipment.
We met with Erik Watterson from one of the other VR groups to learn about his project and to understand how to set up the HTC Vive.
We finished up the week by creating a rough draft of the requirements documentation for the project.

\subsection{Week 6}
This week we were able to meet with Christian from one of the other Intel teams.
We shared information and we plan to do some collaboration through the year.
He was able to bring down an HTC Vive, the stands, and a PC on Thursday for my team.
That evening my Team and I were able to set up the HTC Vive and test out a few free applications.
Towards the end of the week we were also able to complete the Software Requirements Specification for the project.

\subsection{Week 7}
This week we continued to experiment with VR. We've been playing some of the most popular titles from Steam Store.
Playing these polished games has given us a lot of ideas for features that we would like to implement in our game.
For example, we have seen many different ways to display menus, some good and bad.
Similarly, we have seen a couple different ways that developers deal with teleporting in game.
One of the most interesting applications we used was called Tilt Brush by Google.
This application does an amazing job of handling the user experience.
Tilt Brush offers an incredibly user friendly way to interact with a 3d paint brush.
It is intuitive and every single person on my team was able to understand exactly what to do within 10 seconds.
Moving forward we will strive to incorporate similar ideas into our project.
This week I also wrote 3 pieces for the Technology review.

\subsection{Week 8}
This week we made progress in a few areas. First we finished out Tech Review on Monday.
For us, this document ended up being very repetitive because most of our project will be completed in Unity and we were pretty much set on this tool before starting the document.
However, it was still a good exercise to explore how other gaming engines implement certain features.
This week we also completed a "Hello World" type program in Unity.
We were able to create a simple environment using basic assets from the Unity Asset Store and view that in the HTC Vive headset.
Fortunately there is a SteamVR plug-in in the Unity asset store which makes testing our application within the VR experience quick and easy.

\subsection{Week 9}
This week was relatively quiet as a group.
Most of my time was spent just doing some research and working on a basic prototype.
We continued to develop our prototype environment in Unity.
We learnt new aspects of the engine rapidly from online tutorials.
We also put together a statement about our fears and excitements for our project.
We briefly spoke with Mike Premi about our Technology Review and about getting NDA agreements for our team so we can collaborate more with Erik's team.

\subsection{Week 10}
This week we wrote our entire design document, which was super helpful for getting the details of our project into focus.
We plan to use this document as a guide throughout the development process.
Also, we finally all met with Erik Watterson and his team to share ideas and contact information.
We plan to collaborate with them more next term.
