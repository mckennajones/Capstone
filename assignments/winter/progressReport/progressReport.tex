\section{Project Overview (Mckenna Jones)}
This project aims to create a functional and immersive virtual reality outdoor experience that promotes Columbia gear to outdoor enthusiasts and newcomers.
Many outdoor activities initially require a large mental and economic
investment to get started.
This makes people less likely to try new outdoor activities.
The goal of the project is to develop an interactive product demonstration to combat this issue.
This will be accomplished through the use of the HTC Vive and the Unity Game Engine.

\section{Current Status (Mckenna Jones)}
During winter break we spent a considerable amount of time becoming familiar with the Unity Game Engine and developing a basic prototype.
This prototype consisted of a basic terrain that would be suitable for our outdoor fishing experience.
This term our work has been a continuation of the progress we made on that prototype.

The first area we have worked on is improving the terrain that we created in the prototype.
Originally we simply created a environment that looked like someone might fish at.
This term we have done a bit more research and roughly based our environment on a few popular fishing destinations around the Pacific NW.
Our familiarity with the Unity terrain tools allowed us to do this.
It is fairly easy to use various terrain brushes to sculpt both mountainous and flatter areas.

The other big area we have been working on is the user interaction aspect of our project, which will be our primary focus from here on out.
The Unity Package, NewtonVR has been the basis of user interaction thus far.
It makes it the process of creating realistic user interaction in a VR environment relatively painless.
You can essentially just add an \textit{InteractableItem} script to any GameObject, and without many adjustments, the user can interact with them item using the HTC Vive wands.
Currently we have been working with nailing down the interaction with the fishing rod.
The hardest part of this interaction is making it feel realistic.
Currently we have a rigid fishing rod, and rigid fishing line, which clearly does not look as realistic as we would hope.
Unfortunately, none of us have much experience in this type of work.
We would ideally like there to be a realistic flex to the rod.
One solution would be to use some type of 3d modeling program like Blender, but this might be out of the scope of this project.

Towards the beginning of this term we came up with the idea to have our VR experience be centered around a campsite.
We figured that this would be the perfect area of showcase some of the Columbia gear.
After talking with out client from Columbia he informed us that it might make more sense to have the experience be focused on user movement.
This way the user can be wearing Columbia gear in real life, while performing actions in VR, like fishing.
This changed our direction slightly, but not dramatically.

\section{Looking forward}
%what's left to do

\section{Problems Encountered (Jake Jeffreys)}
Throughout our project we have run into many different issues that have ranged in levels of severity.
Since this is the first time any of us have worked on a Virtual Reality project we knew we would be a lot we would need to overcome.
In this section we have laid out some of the largest issues we have run into so far.

\subsection{Collaboration with Other Virtual Reality Teams}
This year there are multiple senior design teams working on Virtual Reality projects.
During the first couple weeks after getting our project assignments we reached out to individuals on the other teams to start building relationships for future collaboration.
Erik Watterson and his team already had a Vive setup before we received our equipment so he was kind enough to share information related to getting started and ramping up in development.
We got a chance to try out his equipment and he shared some advice related to issues they had run into and overcome.
This ranged from software we would need to download to how to effectively setup the base stations.
This information helped us greatly when we received our gear and were getting started.
Moving forward we were excited about collaborating throughout the project but that’s when some roadblocks appeared.
It turns out that Erik’s group has all signed Nondisclosure Agreements which means they have to be incredibly careful with the information they share.
We attempted to get Nondisclosure agreements for our team so we could begin collaborating but we kept hitting dead ends.
Our two teams collaborated on a few of the reports during the first term but once development began there was very little we could share.
This proved to be quite frustrating because their team had already been working on their project for a few months before the beginning of school at their Intel internship.
This meant that they had more experience than us going into first time which we could have learned from.
Instead we had to use online tutorials and just experiment with different techniques which worked out fine in the end.

\subsection{Editor View}
None of us had any experience with Virtual Reality or Unity before starting this project but we were all excited to begin development.
The first step was understanding how to interact with Unity and navigate effectively.
There is a large community behind Unity which is super helpful but that doesn’t mean there aren’t some issues with documentation.
One of the first issues we ran into here was moving around within the editor view.
There was very limited information related to this so we had to figure it out for ourselves through experimentation.
We were able to move around in a relatively mediocre manner but we couldn’t figure out how to move laterally.
After looking at tutorials and on forums we came to the conclusion that it wasn’t a feature they had integrated into Unity yet.
A few weeks later we happened to be working on the project with a different mouse than before and we accidentally pressed down on the scroll wheel.
To our astonishment the whole screened move laterally.
This was incredibly exciting for us and improved our development efficiency exponentially.
We stopped using our mouse pads to do development and now always bring around wireless mice.
It’s unfortunate that this information is so hidden to new users but we’re glad to have discovered this information early on.

\subsection{Free Asset Availability}
One of the reasons we chose Unity over some of the other gaming engines was the community support behind it.
This makes it a great tool for new developers who have never created virtual reality games before.
It also means there are a wide range of free assets to use.
Towards the beginning of development this was great because we didn’t care as much about quality of assets as we did about building up the terrain and developing user interaction.
Now that our terrain is coming together we have started looking into adding realism to our environment.
This is where some issues have started to arise.
Realism is important to us in this project because we want it to feel as genuine and immersive as possible.
This is when free assets aren’t quite enough.
There are lots of free realism tools and techniques we have taken advantage of but when it comes to close user interaction, the objects need to be highly detailed.
In the world of Unity assets, detail costs money. We began making a list of assets we feel would dramatically improve the realism of our experience such as fishing equipment, fish, and high quality grass renderings.
These are the items that we felt would go the farthest in terms of value.
We then discussed this with our client and they were very open to our ideas.
We hope to get the approval shortly and move on to integrating these assets.

\subsection{Incorporating Columbia Gear}
From the beginning we were under the impression that our project was split between displaying Columbia gear and offering an interactive experience.
We spent a good amount of time brainstorming how to best display Columbia gear and allow user interaction of said clothing.
As we started development this term we have been having a hard time getting in contact with our clients to discuss our direction.
During week 5 we were able to talk with Tim from Columbia to get his input on what we’ve been working on.
At this point we discovered that Columbia has already worked on some projects that involve showcasing Columbia gear.
We were unaware of this and therefore we were trying to share our time evenly between the two goals.
We needed to change directions slightly and focus more on interactive activities.
Fortunately, we put our heads together and figured out a way to adapt our environment to follow this goal.
We had been working on a campsite to act as a base location and showcase Columbia gear.
Now we are going to keep it as a base and instead allow the user to walk around an interact with general objects.
This adds to immersion and creates a buffer between starting the experience and starting the fishing activity.
